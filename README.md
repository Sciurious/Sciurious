- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sciurious from England originally but now living in central Italy
- 👀 I’m interested in internet security and privacy and therefore in Google-free life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to change to /e/OS in the first instance.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on installing /e/OS on Gigaset GX4 - so far there seems to be no ROM.
- 📫 How to reach me - through GitHub for the present.
